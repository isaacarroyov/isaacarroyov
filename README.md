### Hello a todas las personas, I'm Isaac Arroyo 🇲🇽 👋

I do data analysis and visualization as a **Data Analyst in [N+ Focus](https://www.nmas.com.mx/nmas-focus/programas)**, the **investigative journalism unit of N+ (Televisa-Univision)**. I work at the **intersection of numbers/math, shapes and colours**.

### Quick summary about my academic background
- ⚛️ I have a BSc. in **Engineering Physics**. 
- 🌳🔥🌳 My undergraduate thesis focused on **exploring and visualizing wildfire records and environmental data** from different sources (**satellite imagery** was one of them 🛰️ 🗺️). Here are a [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-exploration-google-earth-engine-as-my-undergrad-thesis-531ac794dc9b) I wrote and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/isaacarroyov/thesis_undergrad) of my undegrad thesis project.

### My professional interests 🤓
Although my background is in physics, I aim to use my **data analysis and visualization skills** in other fields. For example, **social sciences and human rights** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑👬👭, **the arts** 🎨, **public policy** 🏛️ and **the environment** (hence my undergrad thesis) 🌱🍃.

### My tech, data and math skills 📝
Due to my engineering degree, I have strong knowledge of math (i.e. **statistics** & **linear algebra**) and unsupervised learning (**anomaly detection** & **pattern recognition** ). I mostly do data analysis and visualization with **Python** and **R** (and soon, **Observable Plot**). Also, I know my way with design software (**Adobe Illustrator**) and other types of data visualization tools, such as **Datawrapper** and **Flourish**.

### Other things about me ✨
- 🎧 I love listening to **Alessia Cara**, **Taylor Swift**, **The Warning**, **Last Dinner Party** & **Residente/Calle 13**.
- 🎥 **"The secret life of Walter Mitty"** is my favourite movie and the one that inspired and motivated me to learn photography.
- 🎨 I love **art**, especially **painting and architecture**. I enjoy going to art exhibitions and learning about **art history**.
