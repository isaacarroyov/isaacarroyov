### Hello a todas las personas 👋

My full name (as a proud Mexican 🇲🇽) is Miguel Isaac Arroyo Velázquez (he/him), but I prefer my shorter version: **Isaac Arroyo**.

I'm currently a part-time **Freelance Data Visualization Designer**, meaning I work at the **intersection of numbers, shapes and colours**. I love creating aesthetic, eye-catching and meaningful data visualizations.

### Quick summary about my academic background
- ⚛️ I have a BSc. in **Engineering Physics**. 
- 🌳🔥🌳 My undergraduate thesis focused on **exploring and visualizing wildfire records and environmental data** from different sources (**satellite imagery** was one of them 🛰️ 🗺️). Here are a [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-exploration-google-earth-engine-as-my-undergrad-thesis-531ac794dc9b) I wrote and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/isaacarroyov/thesis_undergrad) of my undegrad thesis project.

### My professional interests 🤓
Although my background is in physics, I aim to use my **data analysis and visualization skills** in other fields. For example, **social sciences and human rights** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑👬👭, **the arts** 🎨, **public policy** 🏛️ and **the environment** (hence my undergrad thesis) 🌱🍃.

### My tech, data and math skills 📝
Due to my engineering degree, I have strong knowledge of math (i.e. **statistics** & **linear algebra**) and unsupervised learning (**anomaly detection** & **pattern recognition** ). I mostly do data analysis with **Python + Jupyter Notebooks**, data visualization with **R + tidyverse** and other types of software, such as **Adobe Illustrator**, **DataWrapper**, or **Flourish**.

### Other things about me ✨
- 🎧 I love listening to **Alessia Cara**, **Residente** & **Calle 13**.
- 📸 My favourite hobby is photography.
- 🎥 **"The secret life of Walter Mitty"** is my favourite movie and the one that inspired and motivated me to learn photography.
