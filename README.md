### Hola I'm Isaac Arroyo 🇲🇽 👋

### Quick summary of my academic background
- ⚛️ I have a BSc. in **Engineering Physics**. 
- 🌳🔥🌳 My undergraduate thesis focused on **exploring and visualizing wildfire records and environmental data** from different sources (**satellite imagery** was one of them 🛰️ 🗺️). Here is a [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-exploration-google-earth-engine-as-my-undergrad-thesis-531ac794dc9b) I wrote and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/isaacarroyov/thesis_undergrad) of my undergrad thesis project.

### My professional interests 🤓
Although my background is in physics, I aim to use my **data analysis and visualization skills** in other fields. For example, **social sciences and human rights** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑👬👭, **the arts** 🎨, **public policy** 🏛️ and **the environment** (hence my undergrad thesis) 🌱🍃.

### My tech, data and math skills 📝
Due to my engineering degree, I have strong knowledge of math (e.g., statistics, linear algebra) and unsupervised learning (anomaly detection, pattern recognition). I mostly do data analysis and visualization with Python and R (and soon, Observable Plot). I also know my way around design software (Adobe Illustrator) and other data visualization tools, such as Datawrapper and Flourish.

### Other things about me ✨
🎧 I love listening to music, especially Alessia Cara, Taylor Swift, The Warning, Kendrick Lamar, The Last Dinner Party, and Residente/Calle 13.
- 🎥 **"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"** and **Dead Poets Society** are my favourite movies.
- 🎨 I love **art**, especially **painting and architecture**. I enjoy going to art exhibitions and learning about **art history**.
